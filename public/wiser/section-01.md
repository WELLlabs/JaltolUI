# WISER Dimensions of Water Security

WISER bridges gaps in water security monitoring by providing a structured framework for tracking meaningful, outcome-based indicators. Current water security assessments primarily focus on inputs and outputs rather than long-term outcomes. A shift toward outcome-oriented tracking is essential to address this gap. WISER consists of six mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive dimensions of water security.

Each dimension comprises specific outcome indicators, carefully selected based on specific criteria to ensure their effectiveness and applicability. The WISER dimensions thus effectively capture meaningful changes, remain relevant and actionable for stakeholders, and can be reliably monitored over time.
